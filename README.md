# Running the Website

To get the website up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have all required packages installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

   ```

3. **Run the Backend**

   Start the Flask application by executing:

   ```bash
   python3 backend.py
   ```

   The website should now be accessible on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
